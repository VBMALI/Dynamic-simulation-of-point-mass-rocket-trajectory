# Dynamic-simulation-of-point-mass-rocket-trajectory
- This project aims at creating a signal-based math-model in Simulink and component-based physical model in Simscape for simulating the point mass rocket trajectory and verifying the results of these simulations with different methods. The verification results, MatLab code description is discussed in detail in this project. 
- Signal-based math model & component based physical model is built in Simulink & Simscape respectively for simulating the system. For creating the models, the buses and variant sub-systems of Simulink are used. 
- Results of scenario 1 of Simulink model are compared with the results of closed form or exact solution. Results of scenario 2 of signal-based model are compared with the results of components-based physical model. Finally, the entire simulation is verified by cross-validating the total energy from burnout to impact time for both scenarios.
- The signal based mathematical model and component based physical models are closely matching in terms of numerical results and the numerical erros between two are less than the expected. Thus, verification of both models is explicitly proven and the same math model can be utilized for different types of trajectory simulations.
